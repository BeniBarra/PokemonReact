# PokemonReact
*This project was created as a tutorial and template to teach my brother Front End web app development and general coding practices.*

## ~ A tribute to the first 151 pokemon from Bulbasaur to Mew ~
#### The function of this Front End server is to query our own Back End that will handle the requesting of information for the original 151. With the data response from pokeapi, the data is then filtered in the backend and assigned to pokemon models that will only contain the data about the pokemon that will be displayed in the Front End (ex: Name, Stats, Description, Image) Additional fucntions of the front end will be the ability to log in, and create an editable list of favorite pokemon
